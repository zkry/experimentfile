# Experimentfile

An Experimentfile allows for the quick definition of various configurations and a specification
of the traffic that they should get. Go code for working with this data is then generated anlong
with the JSON configuration of the values. Such values can be read in during the run-time of a 
Go program, allowing a complete decoupling of config/traffic from the Go code.
